        Hi everyone, my Name is Nermin and IÂ´m certified Nurse working and living in Germany. I originally come from Bosnia and Herzegowina, small Land where it all began.
        At the moment altough I love my job, I really want to start and learn something new. This is one of my first projects thanks to Udemy. I hope that is enough for me to learn new skills and get a new job.
